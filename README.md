A very simple parser in Rust ðŸ¦€

I'm gonna be following the course [Building an Interpreter from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/parser-from-scratch/) which develop a parser, step by step in JS, but translating trhe code in Rust.

**Please, don't use as reference of Nothing. I'm learning rust so it will have a lot of mistakes, bad code and bad practices.**
